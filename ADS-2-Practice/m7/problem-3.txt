Maximum Spanning Tree

To find a maximum spanning tree we can use kruskal's algorithm.

We have to tweak it a little bit to get a Maximum Spanning Tree instead of a minumum one.

We have sort the adjacency list in descending order instead of ascending order and apply kruskal's algorithm

Consider the edges that do'nt lead to cycles in the MST, ignore such edges

When we are done iterating for V -1 times V being the no of verticies in the given graph

We get our Maximum Spanning Tree
